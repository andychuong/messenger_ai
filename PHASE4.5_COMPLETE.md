## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Creator as Admin:** The user who creates the group automatically becomes the first admin
2. **Minimum Members:** Groups require at least 2 other members (3 total including creator)
3. **Group Name Optional:** If no name provided, shows participant names like "Alice, Bob, Charlie"
4. **System Messages:** Not counted in unread count, don't update lastMessage
5. **Leave vs Remove:** Members use "Leave", admins can "Remove" others
6. **Last Member:** When last member leaves, group is automatically deleted

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Legacy ChatView initializer maintained
- ✅ Existing direct chats work unchanged
- ✅ Firestore rules backward compatible
- ✅ All Phase 3 & 4 features still functional

### Performance Considerations
- Participant list fetched once per conversation view
- Real-time updates for members changes
- System messages lightweight (no media)
- Efficient Firestore queries (participants array contains)

---

## ✅ Phase 4.5 Status: COMPLETE

All planned features implemented and ready for testing.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. Test all group functionality
3. Fix any bugs discovered
4. Consider optional Cloud Functions updates
5. Proceed to Phase 5 (Voice/Video Calling) or additional features
