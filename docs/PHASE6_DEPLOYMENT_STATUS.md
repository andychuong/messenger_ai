**Key Features:**
```
‚úÖ User document validation
‚úÖ Message size limit: 20,000 chars (for encrypted text)
‚úÖ Required fields enforcement
‚úÖ Data type validation
‚úÖ Participant verification
‚úÖ Admin-only group management
```

### 2. Storage Security Rules ‚úÖ
**File:** `firebase/storage.rules`  
**Deployed:** October 23, 2025

**Changes:**
- New path for encrypted images: `/images/{conversationId}/{fileName}`
- Support for `application/octet-stream` content type
- Increased size limit to 15MB for encrypted files
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy paths

**Key Features:**
```
‚úÖ Encrypted file uploads (.enc extension)
‚úÖ Size limit: 15MB (accounts for encryption overhead)

## What's Protected Now

### üîí Firestore Database
**Before Phase 6:**
- Basic participant validation
- Limited field validation
- Minimal structure enforcement

**After Phase 6:**
```
‚úÖ Strict message validation
‚úÖ Required fields enforced
‚úÖ Data types validated
‚úÖ Size limits enforced
‚úÖ Encrypted text supported
‚úÖ Core fields immutable
‚úÖ Public key storage
```

### üîí Firebase Storage
**Before Phase 6:**
- Images stored as `.jpg` files
- Content-Type: `image/jpeg`
- Viewable in console
- Max size: 10MB

**After Phase 6:**
```
‚úÖ Images encrypted as .enc files
‚úÖ Content-Type: application/octet-stream
‚úÖ Not viewable in console
‚úÖ Max size: 15MB
‚úÖ New secure path structure
‚úÖ Backward compatible
```

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the deployment:

### Firebase Console Tests
- [ ] **Test 1:** Check Firestore rules are active
  - Navigate to Firestore Rules tab
  - Verify last modified timestamp is today
  
- [ ] **Test 2:** Check Storage rules are active
  - Navigate to Storage Rules tab
  - Verify last modified timestamp is today

- [ ] **Test 3:** Send a message and verify encryption
  - Use iOS app to send message
  - Open Firestore ‚Üí conversations ‚Üí messages
  - Verify `text` field is base64 encrypted string

- [ ] **Test 4:** Upload image and verify encryption
  - Use iOS app to send image
  - Open Storage ‚Üí images folder
  - Verify file has `.enc` extension
  - Verify cannot preview in console

### iOS App Tests
- [ ] **Test 5:** New user signup generates keys
- [ ] **Test 6:** Existing user login generates keys if needed
- [ ] **Test 7:** Messages decrypt and display correctly
- [ ] **Test 8:** Images decrypt and display correctly
- [ ] **Test 9:** Logout deletes all keys
- [ ] **Test 10:** Re-login restores functionality

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is simple:

### Option 1: Revert Rules in Console
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Rules
3. Click "History" tab
4. Select previous version
5. Click "Rollback"

### Option 2: Redeploy Previous Rules
```bash
# Checkout previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Redeploy old rules
cd firebase
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage

# Return to latest code
git checkout main
```

### Option 3: Emergency Rule Update
If immediate fix needed, edit rules directly in Firebase Console.

---

## Monitoring

### What to Monitor
1. **Error Rates:** Check for encryption/decryption errors
2. **Performance:** Monitor message send/receive latency
3. **User Reports:** Look for "message not displaying" reports
4. **Storage Usage:** Monitor encrypted file sizes
5. **Firestore Errors:** Check for permission denied errors

### Where to Monitor
- **Firebase Console:** Performance tab
- **Xcode:** Console logs
- **Analytics:** Crash reports (if configured)
- **User Feedback:** Support channels

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Target | Alert If |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Encryption Time | <5ms | >10ms |
| Decryption Time | <5ms | >10ms |
| Message Send Success | >99% | <95% |
| Image Upload Success | >99% | <95% |
| Permission Errors | 0 | >10/hour |

## Next Phase Preparation

### Phase 7: AI Features - Translation
**Consideration:** How to handle AI with E2EE?

**Options:**
1. **Client-Side Decryption:** Decrypt before sending to AI (requires user consent)
2. **Disable AI:** For privacy-sensitive conversations
3. **Homomorphic Encryption:** Compute on encrypted data (complex)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 with clear user consent UI
