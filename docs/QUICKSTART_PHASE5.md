# Phase 5: Voice/Video Calling - Quick Start

## üéØ What You Need to Know

**Phase 5 adds voice and video calling to your messaging app using WebRTC!**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Physical Devices Required

**You CANNOT test calls in the iOS Simulator**
- Need 2 physical iPhones
- iOS 17.0+
- Camera and microphone access
- Good WiFi or cellular connection

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add WebRTC Framework

Open Xcode:
```
File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies...
```

Enter URL:
```
https://github.com/stasel/WebRTC.git
```

Version: `115.0.0`

Click "Add Package" ‚Üí Select target `messagingapp` ‚Üí Done

**More details:** See `PHASE5_WEBRTC_PACKAGE.md`

### Step 2: Deploy Cloud Functions

```bash
cd firebase/functions
npm install
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions:sendCallNotification
```

### Step 3: Build on Two Devices

1. Connect iPhone A via USB
2. Build and run in Xcode (Cmd+R)
3. Sign in with User A
4. Repeat with iPhone B and User B

## üß™ Quick Test

### Test Audio Call

**Device A:**
1. Open chat with User B
2. Tap phone icon (üîä) in top right
3. Wait...

**Device B:**
1. Incoming call notification appears
2. Tap "Accept" (green button)
3. You should hear User A!

**Both Devices:**
- Speak and listen to test audio
- Tap red button to end call

### Test Video Call

Same as audio, but:
- Tap video icon (üìπ) instead
- Both should see each other's video
- Local video appears in small corner
- Remote video fills the screen

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No such module 'WebRTC'"

Clean build:
```bash
# In Terminal
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
```

Then in Xcode: Shift+Cmd+K, then Cmd+B

### Call doesn't connect

1. Check both devices have internet
2. Verify Cloud Function deployed:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --limit 10
   ```
3. Check Firestore rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### No incoming call notification

1. Check FCM tokens in Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí users
2. Grant notification permissions in Settings
3. Verify `CallService.startListening()` is called (it's in messagingappApp.swift)

### Permission denied

1. Check Info.plist has usage descriptions
2. Uninstall and reinstall app
3. Grant permissions in Settings ‚Üí [Your App]
