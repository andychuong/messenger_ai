```javascript
match /calls/{callId} {
  // Can read if you're caller or recipient
  allow read: if isSignedIn() && 
    (request.auth.uid == resource.data.callerId || 
     request.auth.uid == resource.data.recipientId);
  
  // Can create if you're the caller
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && 
    request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.callerId;
  
  // Can update if you're involved (for signaling)

    (request.auth.uid == resource.data.callerId || 
     request.auth.uid == resource.data.recipientId);
  
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Only participants can access call documents

**Why:**
- Simulator doesn't have camera access
- WebRTC video rendering requires Metal (limited in simulator)
- Audio routing behaves differently
- Background modes don't work properly

**Testing Setup:**
- ✅ Two physical iOS devices
- ✅ Different user accounts on each
- ✅ Good network connectivity (WiFi or strong cellular)
- ✅ Firebase Cloud Functions deployed
- ✅ Both users added as friends

**See PHASE5_TESTING_GUIDE.md for comprehensive testing procedures**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Call Doesn't Connect
**Check:**
- Network connectivity on both devices
- Firestore rules allow call creation/updates
- ICE candidates being exchanged (check Firestore)
- WebRTC peer connection state (check logs)

### No Incoming Call Notification
**Check:**
- FCM token registered in user document
- Cloud Function deployed (`firebase deploy --only functions`)
- Notification permissions granted
- App listening for calls (CallService.startListening called)

### Audio/Video Quality Issues
**Check:**
- Network speed and stability
- Try WiFi instead of cellular
- Check device performance (older devices may struggle)
- Verify microphone/camera not used by other app

### Permission Errors
**Check:**
- Info.plist contains usage descriptions
- User granted permissions in Settings
- CallViewModel checks permissions before call
- Re-request permissions if denied
