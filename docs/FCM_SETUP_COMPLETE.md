# 🔔 Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Setup Complete

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The app now has **full push notification support** using Firebase Cloud Messaging. Users will receive real-time notifications for messages, calls, and friend requests.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **NotificationService** (`Services/NotificationService.swift`)
A comprehensive service that handles all notification-related functionality:

- ✅ **Permission Management**: Requests and tracks notification authorization
- ✅ **FCM Token Management**: Retrieves, stores, and refreshes FCM tokens
- ✅ **Firestore Integration**: Saves/removes tokens to/from user documents
- ✅ **Deep Linking**: Handles notification taps and navigation
- ✅ **MessagingDelegate**: Responds to FCM token updates

**Key Methods**:
```swift
// Request notification permission from user
await NotificationService.shared.requestPermission()

// Get FCM token from Firebase
await NotificationService.shared.getFCMToken()

// Save token to Firestore user document
await NotificationService.shared.saveTokenToFirestore(userId: userId)

// Remove token on logout
await NotificationService.shared.removeTokenFromFirestore(userId: userId)

// Handle notification tap (returns conversationId for deep linking)
NotificationService.shared.handleNotificationTap(userInfo: userInfo)
```

---

### 2. **AppDelegate** (`App/AppDelegate.swift`)
Implements iOS app lifecycle and notification callbacks:

- ✅ **APNs Registration**: Handles device token registration
- ✅ **Foreground Notifications**: Shows notifications even when app is active
- ✅ **Notification Tap Handling**: Opens relevant conversation when tapped
- ✅ **UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate**: Manages notification presentation

**Notification Flow**:
```
User taps notification → AppDelegate receives tap → 
Posts "OpenConversation" notification → 
App navigates to conversation
```

---

### 3. **AuthService Integration** (`Services/AuthService.swift`)
Integrated notification setup into authentication flow:

- ✅ **Auto-registration on Login**: Requests permission and saves token
- ✅ **Auto-registration on Sign Up**: New users get notifications immediately
- ✅ **Token Cleanup on Logout**: Removes FCM token from Firestore

**Flow**:
```swift
User logs in → 
setupNotifications() called → 
Permission requested → 
FCM token retrieved → 
Token saved to Firestore
```

---

### 4. **App Configuration** (`messagingappApp.swift`)
Connected AppDelegate to SwiftUI app:

```swift
@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate
```

This bridges SwiftUI with UIKit's notification system.

---

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Info.plist
Background modes enabled:
- ✅ `remote-notification` - Push notifications
- ✅ `audio` - Background audio
- ✅ `voip` - Voice calls
- ✅ `fetch` - Background updates

### messagingapp.entitlements
- ✅ `aps-environment: development` - APNs configured for dev

### Firebase Console
Your Cloud Functions already send notifications:
- ✅ `sendMessageNotification` - New messages
- ✅ `sendCallNotification` - Incoming calls
- ✅ `onFriendRequestSent` - New friend requests
- ✅ `onFriendRequestUpdated` - Request accepted/declined

---

## 📱 How It Works

### Message Notification Flow

```
1. User A sends message to User B
   ↓
2. Message saved to Firestore
   ↓
3. Cloud Function `sendMessageNotification` triggered
   ↓
4. Function fetches User B's fcmToken from Firestore
   ↓
5. FCM sends notification to User B's device
   ↓
6. User B sees notification banner
   ↓
7. User B taps notification
   ↓
8. App opens conversation
```

### Token Registration Flow

```
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. NotificationService requests permission
   ↓
3. User grants permission
   ↓
4. iOS registers for remote notifications
   ↓
5. APNs provides device token
   ↓
6. Firebase Messaging exchanges for FCM token
   ↓
7. NotificationService saves token to Firestore
   ↓
8. Backend can now send notifications to this device
```

## 🧪 Testing Push Notifications

### Simulator Testing (Limited)

1. **Create test payload** (`test-notification.json`):
```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "New Message from Alice",
      "body": "Hey! How are you doing?"
    },
    "sound": "default",
    "badge": 1
  },
  "conversationId": "test_conversation_id_123",
  "senderId": "alice_id",
  "senderName": "Alice"
}
```

2. **Send test notification**:
```bash
xcrun simctl push booted com.andychuong.messagingapp test-notification.json
```

**Note**: Simulator testing only shows the UI, but doesn't test the full FCM flow.

---

### Real Device Testing (Full Functionality)

**Requirements**:
- Physical iPhone
- Apple Developer Account (free works)
- App running on device

**To Test**:
1. Build and run app on physical device
2. Log in with a user account
3. Grant notification permission when prompted
4. Check Firestore user document has `fcmToken` field populated
5. Send a message from another account
6. You should receive a real push notification! 🎉

**Verify FCM Token**:
```
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Firestore Database
3. Navigate to `users/{userId}`
4. Check that `fcmToken` field exists and has a long token string
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Notification Received

**Check 1: Permission Granted?**
- App should ask for permission on first login
- Check iOS Settings → Your App → Notifications

**Check 2: FCM Token in Firestore?**
```
Firebase Console → Firestore → users/{userId} → fcmToken
```

**Check 3: Cloud Function Logs**
```bash
cd firebase/functions
firebase functions:log --only sendMessageNotification
```

**Check 4: Device Token Registered?**
- Look for "✅ APNs device token received" in Xcode console
- Look for "✅ FCM Token received: ..." in Xcode console

---

### Notification Doesn't Open Conversation

**Check**: Look for "OpenConversation" notification in logs
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: NSNotification.Name("OpenConversation"),
    object: nil,
    userInfo: ["conversationId": conversationId]
)
```

**Fix**: You need to add an observer in your main views to handle this notification and navigate to the conversation.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps: Deep Linking

To make notification taps open the correct conversation, add this to `ConversationListView`:

```swift
.onAppear {
    // Listen for notification taps
    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
        forName: NSNotification.Name("OpenConversation"),
        object: nil,
        queue: .main
    ) { notification in
        if let conversationId = notification.userInfo?["conversationId"] as? String {
            // Navigate to conversation
            // Implementation depends on your navigation structure
        }
    }
}
```
