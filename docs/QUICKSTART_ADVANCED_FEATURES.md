## Quick Start

### 1. Review Full Plan
Read [ADVANCED_FEATURES_PLAN.md](./ADVANCED_FEATURES_PLAN.md) for detailed implementation

### 2. Prioritize
Recommended order:
1. **Smart Replies** (biggest UX impact)
2. **File Attachments** (essential feature gap)
3. **Timezone Coordination** (differentiator)
4. **Enhanced Data Extraction** (builds on existing)
5. Rest based on user feedback

### 3. Set Up Environment
- Ensure OpenAI API key has sufficient quota
- Set up Firebase Storage rules
- Configure Cloud Functions region
- Prepare dev/staging environments

### 4. Start Development
Begin with Phase 16.1 (Smart Replies) - highest impact, moderate complexity

---

## Key Decisions Needed

### Before Starting
1. **Budget**: Approve estimated AI costs (~$150-200/month with caching)
2. **Priority**: Confirm which features are must-have vs nice-to-have
3. **Timeline**: 5 weeks realistic? Adjust scope if needed
4. **Resources**: 1-2 developers full-time?
5. **Beta**: Which features to beta test first?

### During Development
1. **File Size Limits**: 10MB ok? Or increase for premium?
2. **Timezone**: Auto-detect on by default?
3. **Smart Replies**: How many suggestions (3, 5, or 7)?
4. **Cultural Context**: Show automatically or on-demand only?
5. **Data Extraction**: Auto-extract or manual trigger?

## Questions?

### Common Questions

**Q: Will this work with encryption?**  
A: Most features require unencrypted messages (except file attachments). Cultural context, smart replies, etc. need AI analysis.

**Q: What about offline support?**  
A: Features queue when offline, process when connection restored. Cached data available offline.

**Q: Cost concerns?**  
A: Aggressive caching (80%+ hit rate) dramatically reduces costs. User quotas available.

**Q: Which feature first?**  
A: Smart Replies - biggest user impact, moderate complexity, builds engagement.

**Q: Multilingual support?**  
A: All features work in 35+ languages. Thoroughly tested with major language pairs.
