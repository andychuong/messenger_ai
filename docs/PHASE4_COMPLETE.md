## Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer
- **ImageService:** Handles all image operations (pick, compress, upload, download)
- **VoiceRecordingService:** Manages audio recording, playback, and upload
- **MessageService:** Extended with image, voice, and thread methods
- All services use async/await for clean async code
- Proper error handling with typed errors

### State Management
- **@Published** properties for reactive UI updates
- **@StateObject** for service instances with lifecycle
- **@MainActor** for UI-safe async operations
- Combine framework for real-time listeners

### UI Architecture
- **MVVM pattern** maintained throughout
- **Separation of concerns:** View → ViewModel → Service
- **Reusable components:** EmojiPicker, VoiceRecorder, ImagePicker
- **Declarative SwiftUI** with state-driven updates

### Real-Time Updates
- Firestore snapshot listeners for live data
- Automatic UI updates on data changes
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Proper listener cleanup in deinit

### Performance Optimizations
- Image compression before upload
- AsyncImage with loading states
- Lazy loading in LazyVStack
- Efficient audio encoding (.m4a AAC)
- Cached transcripts prevent redundant API calls
