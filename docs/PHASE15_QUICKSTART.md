## 📝 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Business Communication
```
Original: "Hey, need that report ASAP!"
Formal: "Good morning, I would appreciate if you could provide the report at your earliest convenience."
```

### Scenario 2: Cultural Context
```
Message: "Let's touch base tomorrow and circle back on this."
Context: 
- "Touch base" = Make contact, check in
- "Circle back" = Return to discuss later
- Formality: Neutral (Business casual)
```

### Scenario 3: Slang Detection
```
Message: "No cap, that's bussin fr fr!"
Detected:
- "No cap" = I'm being serious, not lying
- "Bussin" = Really good, excellent
- "fr fr" = For real, for real (emphasis)
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (Optional)

### Adjust Settings
```swift
// All features enabled by default
UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "culturalContextEnabled")
UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "slangAnalysisEnabled")
UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "formalityAdjustmentEnabled")
```

### Test with Different Languages
1. Settings → Translation → Preferred Language
2. Choose a language (e.g., Spanish)
3. Send messages in that language
4. Test Phase 15 features

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Functions Not Deployed
```bash
# Check deployment status
firebase functions:log --only analyzeCulturalContext

# Redeploy if needed
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Features Not Appearing
1. Check Settings are enabled
2. Ensure message is from another user (not yourself)
3. Verify internet connection
4. Check Firebase console for errors

### Slow Response Times
- First request: 1-3 seconds (normal - AI processing)
- Subsequent views: Instant (cached)
- If consistently slow: Check OpenAI API status

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Cultural Context
- **Appears**: On messages from others, when translated or in different language
- **Response Time**: 1-2 seconds first time, instant after
- **Cache**: Persists across app restarts

### Formality Adjustment
- **Appears**: When typing (formality button)
- **Response Time**: 1-2 seconds
- **Cache**: No cache (draft text changes)

### Slang Detection
- **Appears**: On messages from others with slang/idioms
- **Response Time**: 1-2 seconds first time, instant after
