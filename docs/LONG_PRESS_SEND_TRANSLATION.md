# Long Press Send Translation Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to hold the send button to translate their message before sending it. It provides a quick and intuitive way to send translated messages to recipients who speak different languages.

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. **Type a message** in the input field
2. **Long-press the send button** (hold for 0.5 seconds)
3. **Select a target language** from the popup menu:
   - Spanish
   - French
   - German
   - Japanese
   - Chinese
   - Italian
   - Portuguese
   - "More Languages..." (opens full language picker)
4. The message is **automatically translated and sent**

### Visual Feedback
- **Haptic feedback** when long-press triggers
- **Loading indicator** replaces send button during translation
- **Error toast** if translation fails

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### `ChatView.swift`
- Added `@State` variables:
  - `showingSendTranslatedMenu`: Controls the confirmation dialog
  - `isTranslatingSend`: Shows loading state during translation
  - `languagePickerMode`: Enum to differentiate between preference mode and translate-send mode

- Added `LanguagePickerMode` enum:
  ```swift
  enum LanguagePickerMode {
      case preference  // Normal mode: set preferred language
      case translateSend  // Translate and send the current message
  }
  ```

- Modified send button:
  - Added `.simultaneousGesture` with `LongPressGesture`
  - Shows loading indicator when `isTranslatingSend` is true

- Added `confirmationDialog`:
  - Shows 7 popular languages
  - "More Languages..." option opens full language picker in translate-send mode
  - "Cancel" button to dismiss

- Added `sendTranslatedMessage(to:)` helper function:
  - Calls `TranslationService.shared.translateText()`
  - Replaces message text with translated version
  - Sends the translated message
  - Handles errors with toast notifications

#### `TranslationService.swift`
- Added new method: `translateText(text:targetLanguage:)`
  - Translates text directly without requiring a message ID
  - Uses the existing `translateMessage` Cloud Function
  - Returns `TranslationResult` with original and translated text

### Technical Flow

```
User long-presses send button
        ↓
Haptic feedback + Show confirmation dialog
        ↓
User selects language
        ↓
Call TranslationService.translateText()
        ↓
Replace messageText with translated version
        ↓
Send message normally
        ↓
Clear input and re-focus
```

### Error Handling
- Translation failures show error message through view model's error alert
- Loading state prevents multiple simultaneous translations
- Original message text is preserved if translation fails
- Error details included in error message for debugging

## Integration with Existing Features

### Language Picker Modes
The language picker now supports two modes:
1. **Preference Mode** (default):
   - Accessed via long-press on translate button in toolbar
   - Sets user's preferred language for auto-translation
   - Original behavior maintained

2. **Translate-Send Mode**:
   - Accessed via "More Languages..." in send translation menu
   - Translates and sends the current message
   - Automatically resets to preference mode after use

### Translation Service
The existing `TranslationService` is used with a new convenience method:
- Reuses existing Cloud Function infrastructure
- Maintains consistency with other translation features
- No additional backend changes required

## Design Decisions

### Why Long Press?
- **Intuitive**: Similar to iMessage's long-press gestures
- **Non-intrusive**: Doesn't clutter the UI with additional buttons
- **Discoverable**: Users naturally explore long-press gestures on primary actions

### Why Show Popular Languages First?
- **Speed**: Common languages accessible with one tap
- **Convenience**: Most users translate to same languages repeatedly
- **Fallback**: "More Languages..." available for less common languages

### Why Translate-Then-Send vs Send-Then-Translate?
- **User Control**: User sees what they're sending
- **Confirmation**: Message appears in chat as it will be received
- **Consistency**: Same message storage as regular messages

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Long-press on send button shows translation menu
- [ ] Short tap on send button sends message normally
- [ ] All 7 quick languages translate correctly
- [ ] "More Languages..." opens full language picker
- [ ] Full language picker in translate-send mode works
- [ ] Translated message is sent successfully
- [ ] Input field clears after sending

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Translation errors show toast
- [ ] Empty messages cannot trigger translation
- [ ] Multiple rapid long-presses handled gracefully
- [ ] Cancel button dismisses menu without sending
- [ ] Works with both regular and encrypted messages
- [ ] Works in both direct and group chats

### UI/UX
- [ ] Haptic feedback on long-press
- [ ] Loading indicator during translation
- [ ] Send button disabled during translation
- [ ] Keyboard focus returns after sending
- [ ] Confirmation dialog displays correctly
- [ ] Language picker displays correctly

### Integration
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with normal send button tap
- [ ] Toolbar language picker still works for preferences
- [ ] Auto-translation setting not affected
- [ ] Works with formality adjustment (can adjust then translate-send)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Language Detection**: Auto-detect source language for better translations
2. **Translation Preview**: Show preview before sending
3. **Recent Languages**: Remember last used translation languages
4. **Quick Language Toggle**: Double-tap to send in last used language
5. **Bulk Translation**: Long-press on multiple selected messages

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Pre-translation**: Start translating on long-press before language selection
2. **Caching**: Cache common phrase translations
3. **Batch Processing**: If sending to group, translate once per language needed

## Known Limitations
- Requires active internet connection
- Translation quality depends on GPT-4o API
- No offline support
- No translation preview before sending

## API Costs
- Uses existing `translateMessage` Cloud Function
- Cost per translation: ~$0.001-0.002 (GPT-4o API)
- No additional backend infrastructure needed
